        "In XXXX, I and my ex-husband applied for a refinance & HELOC from Beneficial. The loans were granted. My ex-husband passed away XXXX XXXX. At this time I contacted a lawyer to determine my options for having my husband removed from the title to the property and mortgage. Lawyer took care of having husband removed from the title. I recently attempted to apply for refinance to remove him from the mortgage and take cash out. I learned through an attempt to refinance I was unable to refinance the property due to there is no deed from XXXX found indicating my interest in the property. The only deed filed with the XXXX County Illinois Recorder was in XXXX with the original purchase of the home in which my ex-husband was the only one listed on the deed. Beneficial did file a mortgage on XXXX, XXXX on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it was never deeded in my name as one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for over 20 years and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it was just quit claimed to me XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.",

This is a VA loan, my husband served his country for 20 years to be taken advantage of and lied to so someone could make a few dollars. The lending agent from Quicken loans specifically told us our payments would be applied to our loan every two weeks as paid and not held in suspense. Once the loan was cleared we became aware of the fact that the funds that are automatically taken out of our account were indeed held in suspense until the full monthly payment is collected, plus an extra XXXX a month and then all of the funds are held until the date the payment is due. The loan we had previously was done the same way and we were emphatic about my payments being applied every two weeks. The end result is we paid XXXX in closing fees to get exactly the same thing I had before. They are auto deducting my payments every 14 days and holding them until the until the due date so we are not getting credit on the interest for paying every two weeks, nor for paying early, nor for paying extra monthly.

I have never made a complaint, but this situation has been so aggregious and so consumer unfriendly, I thought it important to bring it to your attention.

        "My husband opened a health savings account with Bank of America Benefit Solutions. When he died in XX/XX/XXXX there was a substantial balance in the account, and I, his wife, was the beneficiary. I knew that IRS rules provided that the named spouse beneficiary \" assumes the account. '' However, when I called to discuss the situation I was told the account would be closed and funds sent to me. I specifically said I did not want the account to be closed. I followed this up with a letter the same day reiterating my wish that the account not be closed and asking that someone contact me about the proper handling of the account. I heard nothing. When I followed up with a phone call, I was told the account was closed and a check was on the way to me. I spoke with several people, all of whom told me the account had to be closed. However, I knew IRS publication XXXX indicated that upon death of account holder, the \" account is treated as the spouse 's HSA. '' The major problem with their closing the account was that they did it around XX/XX/XXXX -- against my wishes -- and at a time when the value of investments in the account had plunged. These investments soon rebounded and even gained in value. However, I missed out on these earnings. I filed a complained with the BBB and the bank restored opened an account in my name and cancelled payment on the check to me. However, the bank has refused to provide me with information about the value of the account as of the date of my husband 's death and the holdings in the investment accounts as of his death and as of the date they sold the investments. As the law says I should \" assume '' this account, I am entitled to this information. I have attempted to get the information from the bank but they refuse. I have no way to know if they restored the correct amount to the account. The bank later made a cash deposit to the account, apparently correcting some error. However, I have no information to assess what they have done. In effect, the bank erroneously made the only investment decisions for the account until I sold the investments in XX/XX/XXXX as I prepare to move the account to an HSA administrator that is more professional. The bank 's website information about the treatment of HSA accounts upon accountholder 's death has changed more than once since my husband 's death and now says the bank has discretion about the treatment of accounts upon death. Are accountholders subject to the whims of a bank clerk? I believe the bank has callously violated my rights and that I have suffered a financial loss as a result. Without all of the required information, it is difficult to assess the damage, but I believe that if the account had simply been changed to my name there would be several more thousand dollars in it than there is now. To make matters worse, this debacle occurred when I was already struggling with the effects of my husband 's death. While other financial institutions were careful to provide detailed information accounts and options, Bank of America ignored my request for information and closed the account without any consideration of the effect it would have on its value. I believe they are mishandling health savings accounts.",

        "This is a complaint against First Hawaiian Bank for its grossly incompetent management of its supposedly new and improved website. I 've been a customer since approximately 2003, and I have never had problems with my account as bad as I have in the last few months with the roll-out of the new site. \r\n\r\nTonight, I spent one hour trying very hard to access my account online and then trying to transfer funds. Along the way, I made two phone calls to FHB Online where I spoke with a total of four representatives. Not one of them had even the slightest clue of how badly the site was performing. Specifically, every time I tried to perform ANY operation, the site automatically displayed an error message. When I tried to make an external transfer FHB Online stopped the attempted transaction and said it would send a code to my phone for verification. But FHB never called my phone -- even after an hour. The broken system did nearly the same thing when I tried to ( re ) add my XXXX account as an external account. FHB displayed a message that my XXXX account credentials were invalid. ( Yet these were the same credentials that I have been using on my XXXX account for years. So there was nothing wrong with my XXXX online ID, password, or pin. ) But far and away, the very worst issue was my truly sad experience with \" XXXX '' in the Online Banking Department. ( She said it was bank policy to refuse to provide her last name or even an employee number. ) Despite the incredible amount of time XXXX and I spent on the phone with her asking me the same questions over-and-over again, she could not understand that the FHB site was not performing as she expected it to. For example, she insisted there would be a blue arrow in front of my name. After asking me about this three times, I refused to answer the same question anymore. I had enough with the FHB site and its employees who were deeply in the dark about the site 's issues. \r\n\r\nThere is obviously something seriously wrong with the FHB website. It is not performing adequately. While I was on the phone with FHB, I had absolutely no problem accessing my XXXX and XXXX accounts. So the issue is not my connection -- and hopefully not even my XXXX browser. Clearly my access to funds through the site is blocked. But I am far more concerned with FHB 's employees ' inability to troubleshoot, assist, or even acknowledge something is wrong.",

The minimum payment was around {$120.00} and I always sent {$130.00} to $ XXXX monthly. We have not used this card except for XXXX which was about {$10.00} a month. So my payment should have went down with the payment I was making. Well when I talked to them after receiving the collection agency notice they told me it is not there responsibility to send out a statement. I said the email they were sending it to was no longer a valid email and he said it does n't matter. I also asked why no one called. You would think if you have a good customer who makes payments on time every month that you would at least make a phone call. Again they said it is not there responsibility. Again I take some responsibility but I never used the card since like XXXX and I know with the payments I was making that I still had a year or so till it would have been paid off. They were not helpful at all. I have flawless credit and now my credit report is showing that I have not made any payment since XXXX of XXXX. As you can see I made the payment every month. I also asked for all the statements for XXXX. When I received them they have been charging me for Payment Safeguard which again I never signed up for. How can they charge people for services that they never signed up for. So now that my minimum due is more than I was sending every month they charged me a late fee from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. When I called the collection agency they told me that my payment due is now almost {$900.00}. They also told me that Citi Bank reduced our credit line so now they are charging me for an over the credit line fee. I again never received a notice that they are lowering this.

My first call after the police was to BB & T. The fraud people were understanding as I was very shakey and upset. I authorized the closing of XXXX of the XXXX accounts but did NOT authorize the closing of the operating account as I had to get to XXXX ASAP to say good bye to my Father who is in XXXX. I already had planr, car and hotel reservations made and would need the debit card when I arrived in XXXX. The XXXX happened on Saturday night of a 3 day weekend and the banks were closed today being Monday. The fraud people were explained that I would have to go in person to the bank to get a new card and since the local branches did n't open until XXXX and I had to be at the airport by XXXX I was given the address and phone number of the branch closest to the XXXX airport. It was agreed that BB & T would keep the account open until I picked up the rental car in XXXX and gor to the Branch to pick up a temporary card. I thought all was well until this morning when I tried to get gas and discovered the account was locked. I have spent the entire day trying to get BB & T to unlock the account. This morning at XXXX I waas told by customer service that he would have to investigate before opening the account but that he would call me no later than XXXX. When he did n't call I tried to call again to discover that he had left for the day. around XXXX I reached someone named XXXX who said he was a supervisor in customer service and that it was his decision not to release the account and that he had notified the fraud department of his decision. He then disconnected the call. In a XXXX, I called the Fraud people back and explained that after multiple calls, always getting different people, being on hold until the call disconnected I was getting desperate. IN the meantime I found out that my Father was worse. I considered delaying the trip one day but without the card I ca n't change the reservations and now realized that if I did n't get there tomorrow afternoon I might not see him alive. The fraud people said their hands were tied. XXXX stayed over an hour after she was due to go home trying to get someone to release the account without succeeding. \r\nWe are XXXX and this is a Business account. We do n't use credit and have no other cards. We have only the money in our pockets. I have no way to get to the branch in XXXX without a car. It is beyond belief that the bank has no one on call with the authority to handle this kind of emergency. I feel like first I was victimized by the XXXX but even worse now I am being victimized bt the bank I trusted. Whose side are they on?",

From a bank 's perspective, I would think that 's counter-intuitive, but it reflects their rates as of today. Even though the XXXX bond market has a normal yield curve, Ally 's in inverted. I believe they wo n't move the rate on the XXXX and XXXX because customers would exercise their option to increase the rate and Ally does n't want to pay up. They should eliminate this deceptive product. If consumers knew that they never intended, in good faith, to budge on these rates, they would have opted to go for a straight CD that paid a little more, rather than paying for the Raise Your XXXX XXXX option - an option that appears worthless. Take their rates today on the XXXX straight CD, which is XXXX. I get XXXX basis points more for a XXXX shorter term CD than the XXXX CD paying XXXX.

        "This complaint has to do with my my previous case # XXXX. For some reason my case was no available for viewing and I did not have the ability to respond to there claim in it 's enity. There last response letter, referred to a letter they claimed I wrote. On XXXX XXXX, I still had not been given any bank records ( I only had the XXXX statement dated XXXX. They claimed I listed all XXXX accounts belonging to in brother. The only information I had were the last XXXX numbers of his checking and Money market accounts. \r\nThey also claimed the letter stated I was claiming reimbursements for XXXX checks. The reason I am certain I did not write such a letter was because a banker, employed by Bank America at a NC branch, called the Check Fraud Claims Dept for me because no one responded to my request and my emails and phone calls wee ignored. We did not ask for payment on utility checks that forged because they had become my responsibility. XXXX of the XXXX checks I was reinbursed for they went back into his closed account. Long story short my account got so screwed up, I would have to hire an accountant to determine if the balance was accurate. \r\nI also am challenging the letter they enclosed was ever written or mailed to me. When someone suggest they withheld monies because they believed I was forgoing the checks. \r\nThat is one letter you would not forget receiving. Do n't have time to point out other errors made by it 's author. \r\nSince they failed to send a copy of my handwriting so you could see my handwriting does n't come close to the checks they claimed I forged. \r\nPlease notice their final response as to why they could not provide me copies of the banking records was because listed in their customer agreement booklet it states that they must retain a clients records for at least 5 years. I did not see where it states copies were not privy to Executor 's and that their banking regulations supersedes the Laws that are on record that they are required to uphold. Maybe because they want to believe they are above the law, someone simply needs to explain that in reality if they were right, all the law suits costing them XXXX, would diminish in numbers, and they could make a profit just by abiding by the law. \r\n, ( DMV. originally was a {$45.00} payment buu in XXXX so many late FES, returned check fee, they were now asking by the live in animal care taker, and errand runner",

So I continued to march forward with searching for a home and on XXXX XXXX I found my dream home for my son and I. Being a XXXX veteran and a single XXXX mother I was finally able to realize the XXXX dream so I thought. On XXXX XXXX I submitted my earnest money check, along with my option fee and my inspection fee. Per XXXX, we could close on XXXX the XXXX. On XXXX XXXX XXXX runs my credit again then on XXXX XXXX I receive an email from XXXX XXXX. I was a bit confused I reached out to XXXX but she was unavailable as usual and XXXX advise because my score dropped they had to send me to XXXX. I was furious to say the least. Yes it dropped you 've only pulled my report 3 times. So I still marched forward because XXXX reassured me there would be no problems and I could get financed with XXXX. Well they pull my report on XXXX XXXX for a fourth time. During this time XXXX has advised myself, my Agent and the Sellers Agent we are still good to go and we will close on XX/XX/XXXX. The time comes and goes and no XXXX. She 's avoiding phone calls and barely returning emails. So we push the date back to the XXXX. XXXX tell the seller Agent on XXXX XXXX we have a clear to close and her clients can go ahead and sign their documents Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX and I can complete mine on Thursday XX/XX/XXXX with a mobile notary. I was advised I could go ahead and do a final walk through on the XXXX. Upon my return from doing my final walk through I receive an email from XXXX advising I do not have the clear to close and we need to push it back another week. At this point we are 41 days into this process and I need answers so on XX/XX/XXXX I started making phone calls only to find out that XXXX has been untruthful through this entire process. On XX/XX/XXXX after speaking with XXXX XXXX of Waterstone Mortgage who told my Agent that we would not be able to close this week on XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, but we could close the week of XXXX XXXX, 2016. I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX advising that XXXX chosen to deny me and she was unable to disclose why and they would send me a letter in the mail I 've yet to receive. After all the deceit, gross negligence, incompetence and failure to perform in a timely manner I 'm out of thousands of dollars. The seller 's kept my earnest monies due to a clause in the contract. I 'm confused as to why I 'm losing out on so much and this was out of my control. Had I and my agent known the truth, we would have cancelled this process within the 24 day time period allotted. But because XXXX continued to reassure all parties involved everything was going smoothly and I had a clear to close on 2 different occasions we kept marching forward.",

        "I want to file a serious complaint against Citicards/Citibank. I had XXXX credit card accounts with them, XXXX Choice Visa, and XXXX ATT Universal card. Both had interest rates around 11.25 %. Immediately after the bank reform act of XXXX, they jacked my rate on both to 29.99 %, even though my account had always been in good standing, and not been late over the years. It caused my minimum payment to go from around {$450.00} and {$350.00} respectively to around {$800.00} and {$500.00} per month. I contacted them immediately to please take the rate back down, as I had been a long time client since XXXX and XXXX respectively. They refused to do so. I told them that that excessive increase was not fair and bordered on usery. They informed me that they were .10 % less than usery! I tried everything to get them to take the rate back considering my account had always been in good standing. They told me that was the only rate available to me at the time. I told them that eventually, I was not going to be able to meet that high payment. They did nothing to help me. Since that time, they added a \" Credit Protector Fee '' for around {$24.00} per month that I did not notice on the statement ( since I always paid it online, and just did n't see it on there ). I have called them over the course of five years, I have called them at least XXXX times to ask for help in a reduction of the interest rate, and they told me they could not offer me any options unless I defaulted on payment! That was exactly what I was trying to avoid happening, to damage my credit. Again, sorry. No options available. Finally, my husband became unemployed as a corporate pilot for four years, and we finally exhausted our bank accounts and funds. I asked if the credit protector insurance that we never authorized, could help pay the bill. They referred me to to the insurance company, and they told us no, we would not qualify. I then went back to Citi and told them I wanted a refund for all that they had charged me for the service that would not pay, plus I did not authorize. They said no. I went into default, not because I wanted to, bu because I had no choice ( no pun intended ). Either pay my mortgage or Citi. I chose to save my house., I am now in collections on both cards, and I feel Citi has completely ruined my credit by what they did with my interest rate, and have put me on the verge of bankruptcy. I feel they owe me a refund for all the excessive interest, since the accounts were always in good standing, and a refund for the Credit Protection Services that were no good. I do n't know what to do, as they have never cooperated. Even when I called to tell them I could not pay their bill at that rate, they refused to make a payment arrangement that I could afford so I could pay them. There must be others out there that they have done the same thing to. Ca n't there be some sort of class action suit brought against them, or some sort of writeoff of the excessive interest? I feel I have paid them all I am going to thru their unjustified excessive interest. At this point, they have turned it over to a collecton agency. Can you help me in some way? I am not opposed to paying them some sort of arrangement, but they have been unwilling to do so in the past, which is why I finally decided to let them go pound sand. I would welcome any help or advice you could give me. Citi has caused me to such financial hardship, that I now am in default with XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, but I am going to contact them tomorrow to see about an arrangement with them. They both have always been wonderful in the past, and I want to pay them what I owe. Not so Citi. I would welcome any help to go after Citibank. Thanks so much!",

        "On XXXX I submitted an application for a refinance loan to XXXX, Mortgage Loan Officer, XXXX, at Bank of America at XXXX , XXXX , GA XXXX. I submitted all requested income verification and 2 years of IRS submissions. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX requested a check for {$500.00} to cover the cost of an appraisal. I assumed that the loan approval was in process and the appraisal was the last step. At no point in our several conversations and face to face meetings did XXXX ever say the loan approval was in jeopardy. The appraisal was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX my loan was declined. While I was surprised that I was not approved, I accepted the declination and simply asked XXXX for the return of my {$500.00}. She never explained to me why she had me pay for the appraisal on a loan she knew I did not qualify for. She said it was not bank policy to refund the appraisal fee even when the loan was denied. \r\n\r\nAfter several months of speaking with other seniors like myself about these questionable practices, I once again contacted XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and asked her to send me a copy of the document I signed which stated that I waived my right to have the appraisal fee returned if the loan was denied. She responded that the appraisals are nonrefundable as they are done by a third party and paid for when the service is completed. Her response ignored my request for a copy of the document I requested and simply stated that a third party was involved, a detail that was never told to me. I repeated my request and this time asked for the document I signed that stated I was aware that the appraisal would be performed by a third party and I would not get a refund if the loan was not approved. I told her that I believed if she could not produce such document then I could assume there was collusion between her and the third party which would be illegal. She has never acknowledged my request for the documentation. Instead she listed a timeline of the process which did not include the date she pre-qualified me for the loan before asking for the appraisal fee. I stated that I was simply asking for the return of the {$500.00} appraisal fee and that it was my desire to handle the matter at the bank level before getting government protection assistance for seniors involved. \r\n\r\nXXXX forwarded my request to XXXX, Vice President, XXXX Sales Manager, Bank of America Home Loans.

        "After my mother died in late 2015, I proceeded to close her estate. I was co-owner with her on XXXX bank accounts with Chase Bank. Since at least XXXX, the bank has refused to return the money I had put in the account amounting to roughly {$2100.00}. After some wrangling back and forth, the account was frozen and then closed due to a fraud alert, but that was straightened out months ago. Now, after at least 5 hours of phone time and writing letters and sending her death certificate which the bank then processed, the bank issued a check in my name to my mother 's former XXXX. Turned out, the check was returned because the mail at my mother 's house was not forwarded to my attention. The bank then destroyed the check. I was then told I needed to change my address. So, I did that over the phone. I 've live in XXXX. After a great deal more time had passed and I had no update from the bank, I called again and was told I needed to update my address IN PERSON. The closest Chase branch is in XXXX. This is the XXXX. I am not driving all the way to XXXX to change my address with the bank. Then, alternatively, they said I would need to go to a notary, call the bank, and ask the bank to fax an affidavit and indemnity agreement for me to sign. I told them I would go to a XXXX nearby to see their notary. Then the notary would fax back the document signed and notarized to the bank so I could get my check. I asked them to be sure and update their notes. That was before the holidays. I was dreading going to XXXX to follow up and close this matter since I was afraid Chase would fail me again. Last Friday, I mustered up my determination once again and called Chase before I went to XXXX. Sure enough, after being transferred to XXXX different people and being on the phone for XXXX minutes -- mostly on hold -- they said they would not send the agreement to XXXX for me to have notarized. They said once again I would have to go to a branch. I have never seen such gross incompetence by a bank before. Finally, I threatened to file a complaint with you, or file suit against them. The rep then transferred me to yet another person -- the first who sounded like she had authority -- and she said they would investigate my complaint. They said it would take up to 24 hours. That was a week ago. I 've still not heard back. How can I get my money back? This is ridiculous! I also want to be paid any interest on the account. Please advise.",

After joining, I visited my local branch office in XXXX, XXXX and spoke to a representative. I provided them with my XXXX to show that I was XXXX XXXX XXXX and deploying. I requested and completed paperwork for my checking, savings, and credit cards to be converted to Military accounts. This conversion would have given me specific benefits that save me a lot of money while over seas and banking. Over the many years that have past, I continued using my bank of America products, such as my debit card. As a loyal member, I never second guessed the bank. I simply did n't have the time to check on my statements and was preoccupied with other important issues, within the Military. Worrying about my bank statements was the last thing on my mind. Recently, I was approved to come home ( USA ) and I settled in XXXX. After buying my home and getting married, I had the peace of mind to sit down and review years of financial statements. When I logged in to my bank of America accounts, I was stunned to learn that I did n't have access to more than several months of information. I began looking through the information I had available. I noticed there were so many fees. There were maintenance fees, International Transaction fees, ATM fees from over seas, overdraft protection fees, and it almost seemed as if there were fees for having too many fees. I called the bank and requested my account be closed, after 11 years of membership. I was told by the representative that my account had never been processed to reflect it was a Military account. This failure to complete that process, meant that I did n't receive the benefits of a Military account. The representative quickly reimbursed me for maintenance fees for this month only. I was informed that I should not have been subject to any fees, specifically maintenance fees of unknown amounts ( as the fee price has fluctuated over my tenure as a member ) and transaction fees, as well. Not to mention, she stated that ATM fees should have been waived too. She quickly transferred me to the Military Department. The new representative agreed that the Military accounts have specific benefits which civilian accounts do n't share. But, unlike the first representative he refused to tell me what those benefits might be. Instead, he asked me to wait a few days, while they reviewed the account to determine which benefits they will approve for me. I was appalled, as the benefits should be what they are, despite the current status of my account. I felt as though they wanted to review what their liability was and then pick and choose what they will reimburse me for. I asked that he explain the benefits and he continued to refuse.",

We found a house XXXX XXXX, I asked the Loan officer to please submit my application and provide the disclosures needed to start the process, the day I found out they never submitted the loan for underwriting approval, I requested for my information to be submitted as soon as possible. on XXXX XXXX I was told the only items needed for final approval/clear to close was the appraisal report and the termite report, they both came in the same day. on XXXX XXXX the processor called saying they needed a copy of my XXXX, I told her that my legal status did n't required a visa. provided the documentation my attorney gave me and asked for them to call XXXX, I was told VA had this requirement. I called VA in AZ who handles CA VA Loan approval. I was told that was n't true,, the underwriting representative told me that VA only requires for the spouses income to be stable, that VA loan was mean to help the veteran. I spoke with the branch manager and loan processing manager, I was told by them that it was a Navy Fed Credit Union. They had my file for over 40 days, my rate was locked and now I 'm they denied my loan since I cant provide this \" XXXX '' that I do n't have. XXXX asked me to ask them to call them to verify the information, they would n't do anything extra to help. I feel they waste all of this time, lowered my fico score from running it so many times and now I have to look for a new lender pay a higher interest rate and fees. Should n't they have checked this before? my loan application clearly disclosed this information, I provided copies of all these docs. I asked multiple times if they needed anything else from me. \r\n\r\nCan you provide give us some advice? This seems very unfair for a applicant and up to a certain point discriminatory as I 'm allow to work in the USA, I have since I was XXXX I 'm now XXXX the close of escrow is XXXX - this house was the perfect house for my husband who is XXXX, the owner had already set up the house for a XXXX person. We do n't want to lose this house. \r\n\r\n\r\nany help will be appreciated Thank you XXXX XXXX",

This is what happened : Interest rates had fallen and I applied to Refinance my home mortgage with US Bank. I was able to lock a low interest rate of 3.375 % for a 30-year fixed mortgage on XX/XX/2016. My initial paperwork and documents were immediately submitted on the same day. I received Conditional Approval of the loan on XX/XX/2016. I quickly submitted the additional documents required for Final Approval on XX/XX/2016. Afterwards, no further supporting documents were ever requested. \r\n\r\nI waited for Final Approval for more than 2 months. No further documents were being requested during this time, but also no decision was being made by Underwriting. During this wait period, I checked with my mortgage officer every 1-2 weeks. I was concerned because it was widely believed that interest rates would be rising. Each time, I was reassured that the application was with Underwriting for \" Final Approval ''. I was reassured nothing else would be required from me. \r\n\r\nBut finally after 2 months, the interest rate lock expired. Underwriting never made a decision, but they never asked for more documents either. I was simply informed that the rate-lock expired, and the new interest rate is higher, and so there would be no purpose to pursue the Refinance any longer. The mortgage officer suggested I now consider pursuing the \" XXXX ARM '' product with them. \r\n\r\nUS Bank and its underwriters, mortgage loan officer and mortgage loan processor did not process my application in Good Faith. They did not request further information beyond XX/XX/XXXX. They had nearly 2 months to make a final decision with all documents and information available to them. They clearly took far beyond a reasonable time to make a decision on the application. They did not uphold their end of the bargain. The rate lock expired while the application sat in their department. It appears they purposefully undermined my application by deferring to make any decision for Final Approval by the Underwriting department, and allowed the rate lock to expire. They did not deny my application. They simply did not make a decision. \r\n\r\nDuring this time, it was widely speculated that interest rates would rise. And after the rate-lock expired, interest rates were indeed higher. I believe they intentionally allowed my application to expire in an attempt to force me into choosing a riskier product, or at least into paying a higher interest rate.",

        "We decided to close our Bank of America ( BOA ) account on XXXX XXXX, 2017. We made two phone calls to BOA, however, both phone calls ended up in the representative not knowing how to handle our request. It appeared that there was a language barrier. We figured that the phone calls would still be recorded as being attempted as gave our identifying information to the rep both times to access our account we were closing. Because of the difficulty we encountered, and since we could not get out of our jobs to go into the local branch, we had to wait a day or so ( time to write a letter, gather the information ) and send a fax to our local branch ( we had received the fax number from a personal banker at this location when we had to previously contact an individual there ). On XXXX XXXX, 2017 at exactly XXXX XXXX eastern time, a fax was delivered to BOA successfully. The fax clearly stated we wanted to close our bank account, it had our signatures and because there is always a possibility of an auto payment not being caught in time for the closure of XXXX account and beginning of another, we informed the bank on the fax that it would be acceptable to take monies out of our savings account to cover anything that would come through before we were able to catch it. It was only about {$150.00} however, because this was supposed to be a seamless transition, we did n't see reason for it even coming to this. \r\nEven though this fax was successfully sent to BOA, we received insufficient funds emails. We were wondering why this was occurring even though we had closed our account, so emailed the executive offices and asked them to intervene. We clearly informed them that phone calls would not work for us with our schedules and that we desired to have any response in writing anyway. An individual by the name of XXXX XXXX from executive resolutions emailed us back on XXXX XXXX, 2017 and stated that she had researched our complaint and would be our \" dedicated '' point of contact. She had stated that she would need the location and/or fax # where the faxed document went with our original account closure request, however, that this is a matter that can not be resolved via email. We replied the same day and gave her the requested information including the confirmation of the fax showing successful fax to the XXXX Florida BOA branch at exactly XXXX XXXX eastern time at fax # XXXX. However, we clearly stated once again that we preferred our response from BOA in writing. XXXX XXXX replied again the same day stating that \" we do not process close requests via email ''. We replied with stating that we are not and have not requested the closure via email and that it WAS done in writing appropriately on XXXX XXXX, 2017 via successful fax after attempting to resolve it by contacting their customer service department twice. We did not hear back from XXXX XXXX, so we ( spouse XXXX XXXX ) left her a voice message at the phone number she left for us of XXXX. He called within the hours requested that she was in the office, but never received a call back from XXXX XXXX about this situation. We continue to receive insufficient funds emails and found out that even though XXXX had been updated with our new account information as default payment option, this had not been changed for every individual active debit ( and some were not changed until we heard back from XXXX executive office today why these changes were not put in place ... this is another complaint we have sent through CFPB as this has caused numerous BOA insufficient fund charges. There are two major issues with this situation ... # 1 is that BOA refused to close our account and because of the # 2 problem of a debtor not updating our payment information properly, the debits continued to go through an open account that should be closed ( BOA ) however is being kept open for some strange reason.",

We expressed CLEARLY to our loan officer, XXXX XXXX, ( NMLS # XXXX ) of Barrett Financial ( NMLS # XXXX ), that {$1800.00} was our max payment budget. \r\nAt that time he pre qualified us for up to {$310000.00}. We found a home we LOVED. The contract was accepted on XXXX XXXX, 2016 with a close of escrow date of XXXX 2016. \r\nWe proceeded as directed to pay for and have a home inspection and termite inspection done for the amount of {$300.00}. \r\nIn Arizona we have a 10 day inspection period and during that time for any reason should the buyer cancel, the full earnest deposit is refunded. We had deposited {$1500.00} into escrow as an earnest deposit. \r\nWe received our INITIAL DISCLOSURES ( attached ) on XXXX XXXX, 2016. 15 days prior to our scheduled closing date. \r\nWe were shocked that our payment was going to be {$1900.00}. We immediately wanted to cancel the transaction, however when we started to investigate, it came very apparent that if we did not proceed with this transaction, we would lose our {$1500.00} earnest. XXXX then told me if I changed my withholding on my check, I would have more money in my net pay, therefore enough money to cover the larger payment. We were told that as recently as 2 weeks prior to the disclosures being provided that Mortgage Insurance rules changed, and that FHA lowered loan limits in XXXX ... XXXX. And that was why the payment was higher. Both of which we were able to determine were just flat out lies. \r\nWe reached out to the Loan Officer and the best he would do is change our loan from Buyer Paid Mortgage Insurance to Lender Paid, thus increasing our rate by .625 %. And poof, magic our payment is {$1700.00} But not once, did he explain how the loan would finance out over the XXXX yr term, and what the cost would be in the long run. \r\nWe also asked XXXX repeatedly to provide us something that had been sent to us that we SIGNED that were the initial disclosures within the required 3 day period. If we missed something ; we own it and move on from the loss. XXXX NEVER responded to the request. I had another loan officer review the docs that were sent on XXXX XXXX, the documents are clearly initial disclosures. \r\nAfter some research, we have found that the INITIAL DISCLOSURES, should have been delivered to us within 3 days of the contract, as the subject property address was the only item missing from completing our application. Due to the complete disregard for Federal Compliance requirements, we paid for an inspection and sacrificed our earnest funds. \r\nWe lost {$1800.00} by cancelling this transaction, because we were not going to feel like hostages to this loan officer, or the loan he was trying to wrap up pretty with a red bow. \r\nWe feel that the protections put in place for the consumer were violated at our cost. \r\nI would like some guidance from the very Federal XXXX agency that is in place to make sure this does not occur again, and I feel that XXXX XXXX and/or Barrett Financial should reimburse us for our losses at the very least. \r\nThank you for your assistance in this matter. \r\nXXXX and XXXX XXXX",

        "My wallet was stolen in Downtown XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I realized this after an hour and immediately called Chase and my other credit card companies to cancel all of my credit cards. The thief did try to buy things and succeeded at spending about {$50.00} on food but was declined from spending over {$400.00} at Target. When I called Chase, I informed them that my wallet had been stolen. I got all my credit and debit cards canceled and re-issued, however Chase did not put a fraud alert on my accounts. Then, 10 days later, someone went into a Chase branch in XXXX, IL and impersonated me using my license, forged my signature and withdrew almost all the money from my checking and savings accounts. I realized this two days later and went to a Chase branch in person to close all of my accounts. When I went to my local Chase branch, the banker I was working with actually admitted that it was negligent for them to have not put any fraud warning on my accounts when I told them that my wallet had been stolen. He also said it was very unusual for someone to actually walk into a bank and impersonate someone else and withdraw money. He helped me file claims and told me it would take 10 business days for me to be refunded. The Chase banker told me that Chase will do their own investigation to figure out how and why this teller allowed someone who was n't me to withdraw my money but also told me that I was n't allowed to know anything about the investigation - I would not be told any results. He told me they 'd have to \" investigate '' to make sure that I was n't scamming them - pretending that my money was gone when in fact I had withdrawn it myself. I filed police reports and everything as well. Well, it has now been 13 business days and I have not been refunded. I just contacted Chase Claims department and without an apology they told me \" it '' just was n't done yet, meaning the \" investigation '' to make sure that I was n't making all this up. The woman on the phone acknowledged that it had been over their stated 10-day turnaround but offered me nothing else than a \" you 'll have to call back in 2-3 days. They 're short-staffed over there. '' I was already really angry at Chase for a ) not putting a fraud alert on my account when they knew my wallet had been stolen and b ) allowing some teller to distribute my money to a criminal who had impersonated me and now I 'm utterly disgusted with them for their lack of concern, negligence and slowness in resolving what was a HUGE mistake on their part. And I do n't even know IF they will be reimbursing me - they may come back and say that they think I 'm scamming them. On top of all of this, I set up security questions to be asked when I call over the phone. I just called them today and was not asked any of the security questions - just my name and address. And guess what? The person who stole my wallet has all of that information and could have easily pretended to be me. Chase needs to implement some better security procedures, such as asking a security question when you go to withdraw large amounts of money, and actually implementing the security questions when they say they will. I do not feel safe banking with them now, nor do I have any confidence in them. If this does not get resolved in a timely manner I will be moving banks.",

        "XX/XX/XXXX my wife and I made an offer on a small farm near XXXX MI. The home sold in XXXX parcels, the land and the house. I contacted Quicken Loans for a mortgage. The home sold for {$290000.00} and the land for {$140000.00}. We told QL we wanted to pay cash for the land and put approximately {$190000.00} on the house. We anticipated a closing date of approximately XXXX XXXX. \r\nWe did not know the exact amount we had because we kept all of our money in a bond fund which paid a dividend in XXXX. QL told me that was n't a problem but they would use {$110000.00} as a planning number for the mortgage and adjust it before closing. I told QL that we had approximately {$30000.00} we could put into the house after the XXXX which was in another account. I wanted to restructure the loan payments then to lower my monthly payment. QL said that was fine, it was called 'recasting a loan '. Interest rate on the loan did not change ; as long as we had more than {$10000.00} to put to principle they would recast ( precompute the Principal and Interest portion of the monthly payment ) for a fee of {$100.00}. This was easily accomplished. QL then approved our mortgage. They then established a VA loan for the mortgage. \r\nQL established the closing date as XXXX XXXX. In XXXX I asked them when they needed to know exactly how much money I was going to have available. I was met with confusion but they would get back with me. On XXXX XXXX QL told me that they had approved the loan, closing XXXX XXXX but there was no recast provision and the loan was for {$110000.00}. \r\nI told them that was wrong, they had promised I could recast and I had {$200000.00} to put to the loan. I asked to speak to the loan officer 's boss. Eventually, a QL executive, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Executive Office/ Senior Resolution Advocate, Quicken Loans Client Relations, Ph : XXXX Ext. XXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX ) called me back, told me she would review the tapes of my conversations with QL and see if I had been misled. \r\n\r\nOn Monday XXXX XXXX she called and told me that \" yes, the tape shows we characterized your loan incorrectly. '' She said she would work to fix the down payment number but did not know exactly how they would fix the recast issue as VA loans did not have recast procedures. Something she acknowledged I had been misled on. She said she would make it right. I told her I had given my word on the closing, the sellers needed to close in the afternoon and we could not slip the date. She said she would research and get with her loan officers and find a solution. We went ahead with the closing on XXXX XXXX XXXX Monday XXXX XXXX she called and said there was no economic reason for QL to make a correction to the loan because at {$94000.00} it was too small and there was no money in it for QL. She would n't do anything until she saw the rates in XXXX. I asked her what rates had to do with anything. She said she would see. I asked what rates needed to be for QL to fix their error. She said she would see in XXXX. \r\n\r\nI need to recast that loan as it 's a {$210.00} difference in payment per month. I may want to recast it a second time several months later. Had I known I could not recast the loan I would have not used a 15 year mortgage ( choosing 30 years instead ) and, at least seriously considered accepting the higher tax I would have paid to withdraw from our XXXX account. I would have not used a VA mortgage either. Also, had they sent the mortgage loan paperwork to me in a timely manner I would have had time to review and correct the deal, but they did n't. They posted it to my 'online ' site the day before, I did n't see any actual paperwork until the closing event. I had already confirmed the closing with the seller, pledging to close on the morning of the XXXX so they could close on their home that afternoon. All of the above is recorded at QL.",

It took XXXX calls to Citi and then several hours of my time to review each charge with their phone rep, confirming which were fraud and which were not. I was told that it would be 4-7 days for those charges to be backed out due to the high volume of work they had due to moving the Costco Cards into their system ( Not my problem ). Ten days later, the charges still had n't been removed. I called, emailed and finally reached out on XXXX XXXX. The social media team took my information, including the log of all the fraudulent charges. Two days later, I received a confirmation that the charges had been credited and the ticket closed. A month later I opened my statement and noticed that XXXX worth of the fraudulent charges were rebilled to my account. I called Citi to ask why. I was on hold for about 30 minutes and then when I finally demaned a manager, I was told it was was because I never talked with a fraud manager to answer some additional questions. I told them nobody from fraud had reached out. They said it would be 1 - 2 days to be me more information. When I finally heard from them, it was via an emailed PDF with no way to actually talk to anybody. The PDF letter referenced XXXX of the XXXX fraudulent charges and said it was re billed because the vendor had already credited the charges. I explained to them that the only credits on my account were from Citi, which were later re billed. There were no credits from the vendor. They said it would have to go back to the fraud dept and to allow 1 to 2 days. It 's been three weeks and Citi has yet to have anybody from their fraud department call me. I 've emailed, called, and once again reached out via social media and even fax. I did received XXXX PDF asking me to confirm that XXXX transaction was n't mine. That appears to have been credited but the same day, I received another PDF saying yet another transaction was going to be re billed. Meanwhile thousands of dollars in fraudulent charges are on my card balance. Every time I call, I 'm told it 's with fraud and they need 1 to 2 days to get back to me. Three weeks is hardly 1 to 2 days. At this point the only fraud is from Citi. The fact that they can arbitrarily put charges on my card, with no justification of their reasoning and then hide behind their customer service department is shameful.

Their corporate office is located in XXXX , PA. \r\n\r\nThree weeks ago I wrote to them telling them to close out my checking account and put my line of credit on a billing cycle as I was moving and it was difficult to bank with them. By example when you call their customer service number, you are put on hold for 10 minutes at a time, each of the 5 times that I have called. When I call their XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX, PA., it rings busy all the time. \r\n\r\nWhen I mailed them the letter 3 weeks ago, I monitored my account and it was never closed out and I never got the mailed monthly billing for my line of credit. \r\n\r\nOn Friday XX/XX/2016 I went to their branch in XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX. Stood around for 15 minutes and was turned away when the branch manager told me she had to go pick up her \" kid '' and a teller would help me. The teller took my name and contact information and said that the girl that just left would call me on Saturday. Since my account was currenltly housed at the XXXX XXXX location, she said that the manager would also call me. Saturday came and went. Monday they were closed. On Tuesday, I called the XXXX XXXX branch and it was like I was talking to the man on the moon. Finally, they told me I had to call XXXX, the branch manager at the XXXX XXXX store. I called that number 14 times in a half hour period and it was busy. \r\n\r\nOn XX/XX/XXXX try, I got a teller who listened, took notes and was going to have the assistant branch manager call me. The branch manager was out. 4 hours later no return call. \r\n\r\nHere is the crux of my complaint. The bank did not close out the account and put me on direct billing. There was about {$75.00} in the unclosed account, and the automatic payment overdrafted my account by {$4.00}. Then in 5 successive 3 day periods, I was charged {$12.00} per 3 day period for an overdraft that the bank created. I got no emails, letters or anything. When I talked to the branch I asked them to close out the account and refund the overdrafts. I also wrote a check for {$1000.00} and applied it against my line of credit. So far the bank has gone dark, not returned my calls and is probably charging an overdraft fee every 3 days. Coincidently, if the bank would have closed the account, I would n't have overdrawn the account and would have made a payment within the grace period of the loan. \r\n\r\nThis bank has no moral compass and they seem to delight in XXXX the customer at every opportunity. This is n't the first time I have had to deal with their egregious management style.",

        "XX/XX/2016, I was pre-approved for a mortgage loan in the amount of {$190000.00} from Bank of the West. Based on the pre-approval, I was able to find and put under contract a home in XXXX, CO for {$190000.00}. I submitted the initial documents and began the loan process XX/XX/XXXX. The home in XXXX, which I lost, appraised for {$36000.00} higher than my purchase price. The appraisal fee was reimbursed to my bank account. One of the provisos of obtaining the loan was to sell my home. I immediately placed my home on the market, received an acceptable offer the first day, and settled on a closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. The closing for the house in Colorado was scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. Throughout the loan process, my realtor and I struggled to maintain contact with the loan consultant, XXXX XXXX. Emails and telephone calls went unanswered. XXXX told me that \" I keep my emails in bold, so I will go through and find the one you 're asking about and get back to you ''. This happened several times to both my realtor and myself. On XXXX, she called and advised me that her \" computer had crashed, and I ca n't find your file ''. I drove to the nearest branch and faxed over the entire loan file. My realtor was concerned about the closing date, and at one point extended the contract to protect my earnest money investment of {$2000.00}. I also paid for the appraisal and a property inspection. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX called me several times, asking for documents she had been given previously. I made 3 trips to the bank branch to fax these items to her again. At this time, I have a loaded XXXX in my driveway, XXXX of my sons had taken time off work to help me move, and the closing on my house was scheduled for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX called me again, and asked me for a Social Security awards letter. She had asked several times before, and was advised by phone and email that I do n't receive social security, and had verified the only income I received. She confronted me, telling me that she was looking at my bank statements, and she could plainly see the automatic deposit of the social security income on 3 months ' statements. I went to the computer and checked my account for the first date she referenced. It was my income tax refund. When I went to the branch to fax more paperwork, I asked for a manager 's number, because XXXX had now called and said that we would not be able to close on XX/XX/XXXX \" due to problems with your loan ''. I was advised by manager XXXX that XXXX had made a mistake calculating my income, and the loan would now be denied because I was outside their guidelines. However, she stated that they \" would make it right '', and immediately began processing a new loan for a lower amount. Unfortunately, I, a widow and XXXX veteran, am at this point, homeless. My house is sold, and the seller of the house in Colorado refused to extend the contract. He was given my {$2000.00} earnest money because we broke the contract. I and my sons drove to Colorado, on the phone with Bank of the West most of the time, trying to work something out. Ultimately, I lost the earnest money and the inspection fee. I had to find a place to live and put my belongings in storage while looking for another house. It was incredibly stressful. I was fortunate to quickly find and put under contract another home, and am currently living there. However, I used most of my savings living through this nightmare, and Bank of the West has now said that \" management has disapproved '' my requests for reimbursement of my expenses. I consulted an attorney who advised me it would be expensive to pursue legal action, and I simply do n't have enough money to do so. I was advised that XXXX 's loans \" have been reassigned '', and I was given another consultant ( XXXX ) to go forward. I eventually had problems with the new loan consultant, and changed lenders.",

Enclosed are supporting documents XXXX, 2016, XXXX, 2016 and XXXX/XXXX/16 and e current mails to XXXX and Schwab, plus fax proof to FDIC. The Schwab e mails all bounce.

Schwab has abysmal XXXX XXXX * due to lack of customer service and thousands negative comments. If I would have known this I would have never used Schwab. \r\nIn a nutshell : I have been Schwab client for over 15 years. Around XXXX 2016, Schwab on line bank failed to document about {$16000.00} of payments. After innumerable calls, for over three weeks, since there was no clarification, I was offended by it, and bank took exception. Without advance notice, they closed my account. All my payees received bounced checks, causing embarrassment and fines. Schwab refused to wire funds ( even if I paid for same ) to a new bank so I can open XXXX and solve these payments. Schwab sent it by snail mail, and I was not in town to receive the funds. Luckily, I have funds in another institution, who had to wire funds to open a new account. My Debit card also was defunded so it was a difficult time, as I do n't have a debit card with the other bank.This caused aggravation that has lasted for months and now continues, causing embarrassment, late fees, and damage to my credit. They blocked me so I could n't find names - phones of payees, making this incredibly difficult to resolve. They had to XXXX me the information, delaying everything. \r\nIn XXXX 2016 Schwab had \" closed '' my account, but this XXXX I received their statement showing they did n't. ( enclosed ) They received and kept my funds, and continued paying arbitrarily my XXXX taxes for two months ( XXXX payments ) without my knowledge. They refunded {$3200.00} to my bank, that I was unaware of. So, this the XXXX ( muni taxes ) was duplicating payments putting economic burden on my finances. \r\nThis XXXX/XXXX/16, when Schwab advised they closed my account, I phoned my payees with pending payments, alerting them they will be receiving checks without funds ( for Schwab refused to not send them the checks although they knew the account had no funds, for Schwab took the funds and sent them by snail mail to my home. Of the payees I phoned, XXXX, advised me they already got the payment, so I did not send new payment. What date Schwab sends funds and when the mail delivers is not exact, so it was not an issue. \r\nI received a letter from XXXX in XXXX demanding I refund Schwab for my XXXX XXXX 's bill, for Schwab had paid with their own funds so needed I refund. Schwab never advised me of that. I learned this from XXXX, and paid XXXX. \r\n\r\nXXXX/XXXX/2016, I attempted to open a new on line bank account, but was refused, claiming I had bad credit from XXXX. I contacted XXXX who explained they take 30 days to repair credit, so I ca n't open the new on line account yet. \r\n( See enclosed e mails ) Schwab 's callousness and poor service has to be reported and please send me a note of how your office will handle this violation of all rules. \r\n\r\nI OK this information be published, provided my name or details are not includes",

        "I believed that my sister was scammed by her real estate agent with the help of the loan officer from Stonegate Mortgage. My sister 's fault was that she trusted her real estate agent with everything - from selling her current house and buying her smaller house. My sister entrusted everything to the real estate agent. My sister does not even know that she needs to get a loan in order to purchase her smaller house. She relied on the real estate XXXX XXXX that she will take care of everything. In short, my sister did not have to communicate with banks or mortgage companies because her real estate agent claimed that she is an expert and she has nothing to worry. I suspect that the real estate agent connived with the loan officer because they want their commissions and they did n't care if my sister ended up not having a house to move into. My sister 's real estate agent did not provide her a copy of my credit score and/or explain to her the process of selling and/or buying a house. My sister does not even know the importance of credit score. Her real estate agent assured her that she was able to buy a house and that was it. My sister found out later that her credit score was less than XXXX and there was no chance for her to be given a mortgage loan with a decent interest rate. It was too late when she found out that Stonegate Mortgage did n't even have the address of the property that she was buying. In short, the pre-approval letter was fake. Unfortunately the loan officer - XXXX XXXX no longer works for Stonegate Mortgage. He is now working at XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA. I need you to please contact XXXX XXXX and have him explain how did he manage to write a pre-approval letter knowing that my sister 's credit score was only XXXX. My sister found out much later that the minimum XXXX score for any home loan program with Stonegate Mortgage is XXXX. I suspect XXXX XXXX bribed XXXX XXXX into writinga fake pre-approval letter. There is an active investigation against XXXX XXXX with the California XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX but the California Department XXXX XXXX XXXX seemed uninterested to find out the truth in reference to the pre-approval letter that XXXX XXXX obviously fabricated. My sister contacted the California Department XXXX XXXX XXXX but they closed her complaint without even contacting XXXX XXXX directly. I need to find out if my sister 's real estate agent paid or bribed XXXX XXXX for him to write a fake pre-approval letter.My sister was able to talk with XXXX XXXX but he would n't elaborate his answer to my sister 's question. First, XXXX XXXX denied writing a pre-approval letter. When my sister insisted that she was holding a copy of the pre-approval letter, he claimed that he only did a favor for her real estate agent. When my sister asked him \" what favor? \", XXXX XXXX got upset and hanged up the phone and refused to talk to my sister since then. I have sought the help of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Team and they referred me to your office. Please help me get the truth on how XXXX XXXX wrote a good pre-approval letter knowing that Stonegate Mortgage does not pre-approve any customer with a credit score of less than XXXX. My sister 's real estate agent denies any wrong doing and XXXX XXXX refused to talk to my sister. The Department of XXXX XXXX does not want to investigate XXXX XXXX. I do n't know who to ask for help anymore. Private attorneys have already collected so much money from my sister and yet they have not answered my question as to how XXXX XXXX came up with the pre-approval letter. Please help me get the answer I need by contacting XXXX XXXX about the \" favor '' he did for XXXX XXXX ( real estate agent ) ; and if Stonegate 's minimum credit score requirement is no less than XXXX and my credit score was XXXX, how did XXXX pre-approve me?",

        "Purchased appliances from Home Depot purchasing appox {$5300.00} on XX/XX/2014. I qualified for a Home Depot credit card, which I used to purchase the appliances. Appliances were bought on a 24 month promotion, interest deferred@26.99 rate. Appliances were held at Home Depot warehouse until I was ready to start my kitchen project and I was unable to go forward with my kitchen project so asked them to return the appliances except for the dishwasher, to just deliver the dishwasher. Home Depot said they would apply it to my home depot credit card and it showed up on my home depot credit card statement as a payment of approx {$4700.00}, even though I never made a payment, but actually goods amounting to {$4700.00} were kept my Home Depot and not delivered. In my mind the promotional amount is now for just {$530.00}, the price of the dishwasher that was delivered to me. I also made XXXX separate purchases later on for approx {$230.00} and {$530.00} on my Home Depot credit card over the 24 month promotion period. Any payments I made were applied to the later purchases first and so the XXXX bal never got paid in time and they based the interest accrued on the original promotional amount of {$5300.00}, so I got stuck with a deferred interest charge of {$1100.00} for the purchase of a {$530.00} dishwasher. I contacted Home Depot credit services ( which I believe is actually Citibank ) and they said that it was reported incorrectly, that they can only go by the info they are given. When I spoke to a manager at the Home Depot store, I was told that I should have cancelled the whole order including the dishwasher and purchased a dishwasher on a new order from scratch. Of course I can not foresee how this is going to play out and believed that Home Depot is operating in my best interest. I opted not to have paper statements and when I went online I am seeing minimum payment due, a small balance, almost {$5000.00} available credit, so am in no way contemplating that I have all this interest accruing on what I consider an unrealistic, fictitious promotional amount of {$5300.00}, you do n't see if you are going online to make a payment. To apply the returned goods and show it as a payment of {$4700.00} is actually fraudulent because that did n't happen, I did n't make a payment, so they can not have their cake and eat it.",

Being first time home buyers we were not aware that we had options regarding our mortgage broker. Our realtor basically told us, this is who you have to use, submit your information to XXXX XXXX for pre-approval so I can show you houses. When our offer was accepted on our new home, we told the mortgage broker that we were interested in a physician home loan. We actually brought this up on 3 different occasions with him, once by phone between him and I, once with my realtor, and once with my father who we were possibly going to use as a co-signer. XXXX said on all 3 occasions that XXXX were not available in the state of Colorado, as they were illegal in some way under Colorado rules. He stated this so confidently that we took his word for it as we did not feel we would know this states market better than he did and went forward with the loan he did have to offer us. We have since learned that physician loans were offered by at least XXXX companies at that time. So as soon as we realized this, we re-contacted XXXX to discuss and see if he could assist us in getting into the XXXX as we originally requested. He again argued that they were not available to us at that time. We asked that he simply pay the PMI that we had lost over the past 6 months and/or closing costs to get us into the right loan. He refused any sort of compromise or discussion. I reached out to his supervisor who directed me to corporate. We had a discussion with corporate after 2 weeks of \" investigation '' with XXXX XXXX. The lawyers first comment to me was, \" I understand you are upset because you were n't offered some sort of physician discount. '' Nope, no discount, just wanted a physician loan. Just frustrating that after 2 weeks of investigation, this is all XXXX had expressed to her ; basically, it felt as if they really did no true investigation of the details and matters pertaining to our situation. \r\n\r\nI feel as a mortgage broker he had a fiduciary duty to provide us with the best loan in our economic interest. In our case, this would have been the physician loan. We have also been advised that we also qualified for FHA loans which also were not offered to us and could have been another more beneficial option for us. Now, either he was uneducated on what is available in the market for physicians ( if so, he had a duty to tell us he was unaware of such a loan and we could have done research on our own, rather than stating they are \" illegal '' or not available in our state ) ; OR he was aware of these loans but could n't write for it himself and thus make a commission/income placing his own economic interest ahead of ours.",

If the lender did not cleared me to sign the contingencies and stating that everything is ok then, I should not proceed signing that made me loose the ability to refund my full down payment. I think it would be fair enough if the lender will reimburse me all hard earned money I lost from their fault.",

The terms of the promotion stated that within 90 days of meeting the requirements, the bonus will be posted to my account or if not, that they will mail me a check. I fulfilled the requirements for the promotion on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and am already past the 90 day waiting period needed for the bonus to be posted.

I communicated my concern that there have been XXXX checking accounts opened, instead of just XXXX, which was what we intended. He told me not to worry about it - that he usually opens XXXX accounts for clients, since the second account would come free anyway. Because I did not want to jeopardize the conditions of the promotion, I did not close the extra ( XXXX ) checking account. Looking back now, I believe that XXXX XXXX intentionally opened XXXX checking accounts, when we intended to open only XXXX account - perhaps to fulfill some bank quota requirements to benefit him.",

        "In XXXX of 2013, Bank of America indicated that the only way they would assist with a refinance on our mortgage was if we stopped making payments.This was repeated multiple times by multiple people at the bank - no assistance without evidence of financial hardship. They indicated that after applying through the TARP program and ceasing to make payments, it would take 3-4 months to renegotiate the loans. THREE YEARS later, we have just received an offer on the second loan, that is substantially above market rate and is nothing more than a 15 year amortization of the original loan. After the initial TARP submission, Bank of America Immediately sold the loan to a different servicer, requiring that we start over and resubmit the first mortgage application. They refused to consider a submission on the second loan until the first loan was negotiated. Re-doing the entire process with XXXX ( the new servicer ) took over 6 months. Once the trial period was over on that loan, we submitted the EXACT completed application that had successfully gone through underwriting at XXXX to Bank Of America. During the process, they lost paperwork, refused to believe they had paperwork, even when said paperwork was pointed out to them, showing on their own website, repeatedly closed the application for non-response, after taking 28 days to ask for the information, then closing the application 24 hours later, in some cases when the requested information had been uploaded to them days before they acknowledged receipt. Every time we approached a decision, they would come up with an entirely new set of issues and we actually had to submit a total of three applications prior to them offering a trial payment. The trial payment was offered with NO disclosure of terms whatsoever. We made the required XXXX trial payments, them made 6 more payments as it took the NINE MONTHS to generate loan documents. At this point, they have ruined our credit - still submitting to the credit agencies that we have not made one on time payment, when in fact we have made nine timely payments.",

        "I was contacted on XX/XX/XXXX email by XXXX from Caliber Home Loans to refinance my current loan with them. I replied on XX/XX/XXXX he gave me an acceptable estimate for refinancing my condo which was already mortgaged with Caliber. XXXX then proceeded to try to get me to refinance my primary home. He presented another favorable quote so I proceeded. We started the process and got both appraisals done and I provided all of the requested documents. The appraisals came back lower than the estimates so XXXX reworked the estimates and I approved and we moved on. This all happened before XXXX. I got a call from my first loan processor XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX herself and stating she was beginning the next phase of my loans. I have never heard another word from XXXX. I began trying to get a status of my loans on XX/XX/XXXX to allow extra time for the holidays. I called and emailed both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Neither of them EVER replied or returned my phone calls. I tried emailing and calling multiple times every day. I called their main number but they were useless. I tried logging onto my account to check the status of my loans but I could n't even access my account because of some IT problem they were having. I finally got someone on the XXXX number to give me someone else 's number. So I started calling XXXX who was supposedly XXXX boss but he never called me back either. On XX/XX/XXXX I got a call back from XXXX and he has been the most responsive but he has gone silent since the holidays. I was then assigned a new loan processor XX/XX/XXXX who basically started all over. I was told my new loan details after the appraisals came back lower were never entered into their system even though I had signed the new loans before XXXX. XXXX sent new estimates and my closing costs were higher even though I was borrowing less. XXXX said it was because my properties were entered as something other than condos and the condo closing costs are higher. He also refused to reimburse me for the appraisals. He said I would get \" credit for paying '' them at closing but I would not get reimbursed as XXXX had told me. He also is not honoring the lender credit I was given. I had locked in my interest rates which expired on XX/XX/2017. Supposedly Caliber extended the rate lock until XX/XX/XXXX but I have only received an email about the rate lock. I have not seen any official documentation. Late last week XXXX said there is a problem with the HOA on my primary property because of pending litigation but that it could still be handled and I could close on both properties if the right departments from Caliber was involved. I have not heard a word from XXXX since and the only communication I received at all was from XXXX 's boss yesterday in an informal email about my rate lock extension. \r\nI know this is a lengthy story but here are my complaints : 1. Deceitful marketing practices. I am confident XXXX intentionally entered my properties into their system as something other than condos to make the deals more attractive in order to get me to refinance. The reason I am confident is because they already hold the loan on one of my properties. \r\n2. Not honoring the agreement of reimbursing me for the appraisals and not giving me the lender credit as promised. \r\n3. The total and complete lack of professionalism in their lack of communication with their customer, me. This is the absolute worst experience I have ever had with any institution wanting my business for anything.",

        "I have made numerous attempts to move forward with a loan assumption through Freedom Mortgage and/or XXXX. I 've completed the email request process per their instructions with the confirmation from them they were going to send me the loan assumption packet within 7-10 business days. It 's been 2 months and no packet. Every time I call, both of these institutions shuffle me back to the other. The one time I did get a hold of someone who was able to pull up my account, they told me they could not move forward until the investor responded back to them, even after it was previously verified that my loan is eligible for assumption. The last time I called, neither institution, Freedom or XXXX could find my account. I feel this is a stalling tactic to dissuade me from allowing my daughter to assume my mortgage and they would rather do a bait and switch to get us to apply for a new mortgage. Please help me get some resolution to this so that we can move forward with the loan assumption. I 'm not in the best health and on a fixed income as I 'm retired.",

        "To Whom It May Concern : I had contacted a local Citibank about refinancing a mortgage that I hold on a home in XXXX XXXX to take cash out of the equity for use in purchasing another home. I held a meeting with a loan officer at Citibank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( NMLS # XXXX ), to discuss their refinance services and asked if they could give me what I would need to purchase a second home : {$150000.00} cash-out from my existing property that is nearly paid off. I provided them with an estimate of the home 's value as well as my income from the last two years, based on my tax returns, as well as the debt that I owe on my cars. The loan officer was optimistic about obtaining the equity, and informed me that I would have to pay for appraisal and application fees upfront, which came out to the disputed amount of {$520.00}. \r\n\r\nI left the office and received the attached document titled, \" First Loan Estimate, '' which listed the amount that I was seeking and an interest rate that XXXX and I previously discussed. However, a few weeks later, I received the Second Loan Estimate, which specified that the loan would drop from {$150000.00} to {$85000.00} while the interest rate would increase from 3.75 % to 4.375 %. I wrote the loan officer an email where I explained that this is not acceptable and if it can not be corrected back to what we discussed, I would like to withdraw the application and to refund me the application and appraisal fees. \r\nThe loan officer called me a few days later and explained that he could possibly raise the amount of the loan again but to give him a few days to see what he could do. I agreed, and then received the document titled Third Loan Estimate, which was for {$110000.00} at 4.375 %. \r\n\r\nI explained that this is not acceptable and that I can not purchase a second home with such a small amount, especially considering the fees associated with the loan. The loan officer agreed to withdraw the application but when I asked him to also refund me my upfront fees he replied, \" Hi XXXX, we wo n't be able to refund the fees. As we had discussed they are not refundable. '' He never stated that the fees were non-refundable prior to paying them ( see the attachment titled Emails ), nor did he ever warn me that the loan amount could drastically change like it did. I would like to ask that the fees I paid be refunded.",

        "I recently applied and was instantly approved ( XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) for the American Express Platinum card through an open online application offering XXXX bonus Membership Rewards points after spending {$3000.00} in the first 3 months. Upon receiving the card, I promptly completed the required spend and waited for the bonus to be awarded. When I had not received the bonus, I proactively called in to verify that all requirements had been met, and I was assured by the phone representative that indeed the requirements had been met and that the bonus would be awarded within a few days. So, I waited a few more days and I was awarded the XXXX bonus points exactly as the rep confirmed. However, on XXXX XXXX, 2016 ( exactly 3 months and 1 day after activating the card thereby initiating the 3 month time clock for the required spend ), AMEX quietly removed the XXXX bonus points from my account without any warning whatsoever. After calling the number on the back of the card to inquire about the situation, I quickly realized that the company 's phone representatives were completely clueless as to why the points had been removed from my account. So, after some brief internet searches, I was able to find that this same issue had happened to numerous consumers who like myself had applied for the card under the same offer and also had their bonus award removed. The general consensus seemed to be that AMEX was claiming that myself as well as many others who had signed up for this {$450.00} annual fee card were in violation of the terms and conditions of the offer. It seems that the offer was not meant to be available to the general public, but had been mistakenly put up online and many people had taken advantage of this lucrative offer. I understand that AMEX went to their fine print T & C 's looking for a way out of awarding the bonus and decided that they could retroactively remove the bonus after the 3 month initial spend requirement deadline had passed. \r\nOK - so AMEX accidentally posts a link to an offer that they never intended to go public, but they go ahead and approve the card application, collect the annual fee, then after the consumer completes the requirements for the bonus they both VERBALLY CONFIRM and go forward with AWARDING the bonus, this seems to be a direct indication to the consumer that ALL REQUIREMENTS HAVE INDEED BEEN MET. Then exactly one day after that period has passed, the company retroactively retracts those points claiming a violation of T & C 's? So should n't I also have the right to retroactively and unilaterally decide to retract my {$450.00} annual fee from the company? My point is not whether on not the T & C 's were violated, but that by VERBALLY CONFIRMING and then AWARDING the points to the consumers accused of T & C violations American Express ACKNOWLEDGED that all requirements had been met. Then by waiting to redact the points from those members ' accounts until after the 3 month initial period had passed, they effectively prevented consumers from being able to meet the said requirements prior to the deadline. I consider this to be highly deceptive marketing practice, and being a long-time AMEX customer, this is a very disappointing response to an error that occurred wholly on their side by inadvertently releasing the offer to the public. If AMEX feels that it is completely within their rights to intentionally wait until the period had passed to do a \" chargeback '' on the consumers who bolster their bottom line, it should also be well within our rights as consumers to perform a \" chargeback '' on the {$450.00} annual fee we each paid to apply for this card. \r\nAMEX should be held accountable for this action, and forced to offer consumers either a refund of their annual fee or an additional 3 months to complete the requirements. This is the United States not XXXX, right? Maybe they should rename the company the XXXX XXXX",

        "Several items in dispute are not resolved with Total Card inc, numerous complaints have been filed against them and nothing done/resolved. The XXXX ( XXXX ), Attorney General of South Dakota, South Dakota dept of banking, have all unresolved complaints against them. Their rep, XXXX XXXX, claims the findings of their investigation were provided to me which is not true. The last information reported to me is the items were charged back to the companies, according to XXXX in fraud. I have heard nothing since. Again, no findings were reported to me because they were not investigated. XXXX was advised XXXX of the companies, XXXX, did issue credit then recharged the account for the same amounts credited. As for the amounts of XXXX both from XXXX XXXX, XXXX was also advised that product/service was not received for either transaction. She stated all charges would be charged back to the companies, this is the last bit of information I received. I wish to reiterate, I was NOT provided any results of findings as again, they were not investigated beyond the point of charge back. it appears XXXX XXXX response is a carbon copy of her last response to the Attorney General complaint, which is also unresolved. She did not state what supposed findings are, just that they were supposedly communicated to me. She further stated I agreed to close the account, which is true, but did not agree to drop any remaining or pending disputes. It appears Total Card is implying they are no longer required to dispute the items further since the account is now closed, XXXX will be notified of this. The credits she refers to are for another disputed item, XXXX from XXXX at XXXX XXXX. This is an incidental deposit for a hotel stay, there was a disagreement over supposed charges made to the room ( s ). The other credit, XXXX, brought the account to XXXX. Please note, these credits were not accepted as matters resolved for the disputes mentioned previously, they do not cover the total charges in the amount of XXXX. As stated in previous complaints, Total Card does nothing to dispute any charges, just a pointless XXXX way conversation with merchant that goes nowhere. Obviously, I would not dispute items unless I already attempted to resolve them directly with merchant, the first step in a dispute process. Please do not mark this as duplicate, the issues are not addressed or resolved.",

        "Starting in XX/XX/XXXX, I called Synchrony Bank about fraud charges on my card. That day, the lady from Synchrony went through every single purchase made on my card and I pointed out the fraud charges to her. From there she transferred my call to the fraud department and they said an investigation would be opened, but they could only pull up the chargers from the pasted 6 months ( since XX/XX/XXXX ) and that they would send me a packet in the mail and I had to write down every fraud charge ever made on my account. I never received this packet. I ended up having to go to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX for family medical reasons and I called Synchrony and explained what was going on. I said that before I left, I never got that packet in the mail and I was n't going to be back in XXXX for several months so I changed my address to the address I was staying at in XXXX. A few weeks later, my parents said my packet came in the mail in XXXX so I called Synchrony Bank and told them that I had called a few weeks before and changed my address because I was n't in XXXX to receive that packet. They had absolutely no record of this in their files. They said I never called and changed my address, but I did. On top of that, they said the fraud investigation was closed and I had been refunded all of the money which was impossible because they only had access from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, and did n't have the completed packet from me to document fraud charges starting back in XX/XX/XXXX. After the man argued with me, they passed me on to a manager in the fraud department and I got them to resend me the packet to the updated address so I could fill it out. He said when I received it to call and go over it so they could reopen the investigation. I received the packet in XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I called them again and went through the packet and every single fraud purchase on my account and the lady said it would take a minimum of 30 days to go over it and re-open the case. During all this time, starting around mid XX/XX/XXXX, I 've been called multiple times a day by Synchrony saying that I 'm past due on paying my bills. Back in XX/XX/XXXX, I was told not to pay any more bills until the investigation was complete, so I had n't paid anything. Starting in XX/XX/XXXX, I 've been getting called multiple times a day from collection agencies saying I was past due on paying my bills. I repeatedly told them that my account was under investigation for fraud and was told not to make anymore payments. Today ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ), after receiving yet another collection call, I called Synchrony and spoke with another fraud manager. He said my investigation was closed XX/XX/XXXX, 7 days not 30, after my investigation was re-opened, but nobody alerted me. He said they did n't have a letter stating it was closed. However, I received a letter in the mail dated AFTER XX/XX/XXXX stating that my investigation was reopened. When I asked the manager for copies of everything they had on my file about this investigation he said \" What do you mean? '' and then proceeded to tell me that they have no letters to send me about my own case. Every single time I 've tried to contact Synchrony Bank about my investigation, I 've either been hung up on or everything we talked about was n't even recorded. I 'd say 3 out of 15+ phone calls with Synchrony were successful. Even after all of this, not all of fraudulent charges have been resolved.",

The other is a statement from XXXX XXXX from the VA disputing the statement from NFCU. Only XXXX is the truth. This issues that need to be addressed are from the response of NFCU in complaint # XXXX and are as follows1 : First of all I would like to know who I am addressing. There was no name attached to the response from complaint # XXXX or complaint # XXXX or complaint # XXXX or complaint # XXXX and if you are qualified to make decisions on my file and why did the loan officer that was handling my loan get fired. \r\n2 : As a requirment to report all loans to regulators, what reason did you use for my denial of the VA loan. Was it the same XXXX you gave me, that I did n't pay my last month 's rent. I do n't believe that is XXXX of the data points outlined in Regulation XXXX Especially after being pre-approved. \r\n3 : The high cost mortgage I was offered. Does it comply with regulations as set forth in Regulation XXXX after I locked in a rate of 4 % just 30 days prior. Why the high cost mortgage? according to my credit report I had no derogatory remarks, no missed payments on anything and my scores were XXXX and XXXX. I attached a copy of my credit report in complaint # XXXX : You stated that NFCU undertook extensive efforts to assist me, but a VA loan was not an option because of unsatisfactory verification of rent and a court judgement. Well I too took extensive efforts to prove that both landlords lied. Without going into lengthy explanations, I did send XXXX XXXX proof along with a satisfaction of lien from the court. I attached a copy of that in complaint # XXXX. So that was not an option to turn me down. Than you stated that NFCU contacted the VA and they confirmed that the loan was not eligible for a guarantee. Please provide proof of that contact. I do n't think you did. \r\n5 : You said you attempted to offer possible assistance, but the number you gave in complaint # XXXX is to a telemarketing company. I did call it for possible assistance. \r\n6 : I am going to have to include your the title company acting as your agent agent. XXXX XXXX. At closing, they failed to disclose anything to me. We just went through page by page with just a sign here. I did n't even know I had mortgage insurance. I am sure they followed all the regulations, but why was my wife added to the note when I distinctly said not too. She receives all correspondence from NFCU including late notices. My question is, did you report her as a co-applicant and if so, did you report her ethnicity as XXXX. \r\nIf you can please address these issues I have I would appreciate it. I am sure the CFPB would be interested also.",

        "XX/XX/XXXX I realized that I was PAYING FOR XXXX PayPal accounts. XXXX that I had set up years ago linked to my credit card and bank account. The second XXXX account was realized By myself in XX/XX/2014- at which time, I telephoned the number on my statement and talked to a CSR and explained my delima and confusion and needed an explanasked for verification of the account, a full accounting of the charges from this account as well as how they got my information. I asked that this be sent to me almost a year ago. I never received any information just continuous phone calls to pay the debt. At this time of collection calls I would request the same information on verification of what was on this account and how it came to be. I reported this account as fraudulent to PAYPAL SMART CONNECT -Synchrony bank - A bank which I had never heard of no requested to ever do business with. \r\nDuring this past year I made payments to this fraudulent account because they told me it was going to be reported to credit agencies as late. They also charged outrageous fees and interest to this unknown account. I had no other choice but to pay in the mean time because they are constantly reporting to all the credit bureaus. This has been a nightmare for me. \r\nThe fraud investigator I spoke with said a whole packet of info old be sent to me and I could explain everything - again nothing about the verification of this account was sent. I received, by mail, a letter a short time later saying the synchrony bank had found a record of payment and they did not consider it fraudulent. I immediately called and went back and fourth with the female \" investigator '' from SYNCHRONY BANK and she said they could not send any verification or paper work about how the account was formed or the expenses charged to account. I hung up and called another fraud reporting telephone number at PAYPAL SMART CONNECT-SYNCHRONY BANK and they took the complaint again and said they would investigate and send verification and the information I was looking for to explain this unknown account with an unknown bank. A short time later a simple XXXX page letter again came via postal mail ( SAME AS THE XXXX ONE ), with NONE of the verification information I requested as verification of this account. I called again and spent considerable time with the same \" XXXX \" from SYNCHRONY BANK - again the investigator kept saying I had a history of paying on the account. I explained that I was unaware of the separateness of the PayPal accounts and hat I never opened this account. I said yes I did pay on the account before I realized I was paying for XXXX PayPal accounts. I also explained that if I did not pay - you assured me that my credit would suffer. She said too bad and you better pay it it on time or your credit will continue to be effected. I asked her for the verification and to speak to her superior officer and she put me through to a message machine to the superior officer, whom said he would call back within 72 hours. I never received any call from the supervision at this fraud investigation ( SCAM ) department. \r\nI am being held hostage by this scam of a bank SYNCHRONY BANK. I blame PAYPAL ALSO! PAYPAL SMART CONNECT ca n't give me any information either accept to say that I have a history of paying the account this year!!!!!! Maddening and now my calls are disconnected completely when I call. This is a crime and they should be held accountable - I have suffered XXXX over this matter and have gotten NOWHERE with this PayPal smart connect. Also SYCNCHRONY BANK NEVER MADE THEIR NAME CLEAR ON ANY STATEMENTS - MAYBE I WOULD HAVE CAUGHT THIS A LONG TIME AGO - they use only initials. Please help me get the verification that I believe is justly my information to receive. Thank you for your assistance on this most disturbing matter with PALPALSMART CONNECT AND SYNCHRONY BANK.",

After Chase acknowledged XXXX Chase employees gave me false information, they said there was nothing they can do to resolve the case. \r\n\r\nOn XX/XX/2017, I went to the Chase Branch ( located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NY XXXX ) to ask for information on their XXXX XXXX XXXX Card. I was interested in the card because Chase advertised free checked baggage benefit and I need that for an upcoming trip the week after. so I asked if the card could be rushed to me - if not, I will not apply for the credit card. XXXX XXXX, the banker in the branch, told me the card would be sent to me in 2-3 business days and I should receive it by XX/XX/2017. He confirmed with XXXX XXXX from Back Office Credit Card Department on the phone. XXXX spoke with me on the phone to verify my address, and confirmed that the card would be rushed out in 2-3 business days ( phone recording is available at Chase ). This later proved to be false information ( details below ), and Chase used false information to mislead me to open a new credit card account. I applied and got the account because I was pre-approved for the card. \r\n\r\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called Chase customer support to check the status. I was told this credit card needs partner verification and always takes 7-10 business days. There is no way to rush the card out in 2-3 business days, and they do not know why their colleagues gave me false information. Had I been given the correct information ( 7-10 days ), I would have never opened the credit card account because the card would not arrive in time. \r\n\r\nOn XX/XX/2017, I went back to the branch and spoke with XXXX XXXX. He spoke with XXXX XXXX from Back Office Credit Card Department on the phone, and both told me I would receive the card in 1-2 business days from XX/XX/2017. I spoke with XXXX and she confirmed ( phone recording is available at Chase ). This contradicted with the information I was given on XX/XX/2017, so I asked for XXXX 's supervisor, who then told me the card needs partner verification and requires 7-10 business days and there was no way to rush the card to me in 1-2 business days. Had I not asked for the supervisor, I would again be waiting with misleading information. \r\n\r\nI then spoke with XXXX XXXX at the branch, who acknowledged the XXXX aforementioned Chase employees have given me false information. I requested compensation since it was clear I would not be able to use the card in time. On the monetary front, I have lost free checked baggage benefit ( {$100.00} ) and the increase in airfare while waiting ( {$200.00} ). On the non-monetary front, Chase 's misrepresentation and misleading information has caused me an inquiry to my credit history, a hit to my credit score, and a loss of substantial credit limit. \r\n\r\nXXXX later told me he spoke with different departments ( including credit card department and executive office ), but they would not compensate me. I asked for names and contact information of the people he spoke with, he refused to give me. Instead, he said XXXX XXXX from Client Services is the highest authority on this and XXXX will reach out to me on XX/XX/2017 or XX/XX/2017 ( 4-5 days from XX/XX/2017 ). XXXX said there is nothing the branch or the credit department can do on this. The way Chase treats a consumer harmed by Chase 's deceptive practices was to shift responsibility within the organization and leave the consumer waiting with no concrete solution.",

I have written them of this bankruptcy, called them about these payments, they are rude and tell me to call back the next day to talk to an analysis, the analysis is not reachable they keep me on hold for upwards of 20 minutes and I call again and get the same treatment. This company is taking payments from me even though I have notified them of the bankruptcy, they refuse to stop or return the money taken against the law of bankruptcy. I have reported them to the bankruptcy trustee, but I still get no results. What do I do to stop this harassment, on the phone they tell me that they do n't have to stop the payments and that I must have a lawyer call them, I explain I represent myself, but that does not matter to them.",

Upon speaking with them, I grew incredulous about two things : 1. I did not activate my account and even responded that the credit limit was not sufficient to open the account ; and, 2. rather than transfer a single account within their imposed {$5000.00} credit limit ( a one to one transfer from XXXX to B of A ), they split my XXXX account, meaning I had to continue paying on my old account and now ... on the bank of America account which I never activated because financially, I am only capable of paying down XXXX credit card balances. \r\n\r\nNow, I am getting up to 5 calls a day at home and work from B of A and it does n't matter who I speak with, there is no amiable resolution.

We were told at the time that the XXXX accounts would be linked and there would n't be any charges or fees as long as we maintained our monthly balance no less than {$1500.00} in our core checking account. Since then, we have met our minimum balance requirement and maintained at least {$100.00} in our savings account as well. \r\nHowever, starting from XX/XX/XXXX, the Bank imposes a monthly charge of {$5.00} on the grounds that our savings account has less than {$300.00} even though our balance in the core checking account always far exceeds {$1500.00} and the two accounts are supposed to be linked. We challenged their unauthorized debit and were told that there was a letter of advice sent out in XX/XX/XXXX. We never receive such letter or any electronic communication from the Bank. \r\nFinally, the Bank agreed to refund me but for some reasons, not the full amount of the 5 months of charges. We file this complaint because we feel being misled and we do n't know how many of consumers are being treated like that. We would appreciate your prompt attention to the matter. \r\nXXXX",

My goal was tocombine my first and second loans with a good interest rate. \r\nI had been receiving adds from Nationstar Mortgageregarding their no appraisal fee or closing cost packages, and since I had a relationship with them, I called them first. \r\n\r\nI was offered a good interest rate but with a 30 year loan. Idecided to proceed. It was an endless process. I was askedto resubmit a loan rate lock weekly, then seemingly moreso ; eeach time with different numbers. My fianc is a financeperson by profession and would point out issues with thenumbers to me and I went round and round with Nationstaruntil we finally came to an agreement and set up a closingdate for XXXX XXXX. I was to bring funds to closing topay for an XXXX XXXX card. \r\n\r\nLate XXXX XXXX I got a call that the underwriters wanted anew homeowners ' policy as the one that I allowed them toplace for me would not suffice for the refinance package. \r\nReally, three month 's later they discovered this? Admittedly, I did not know not did Nationstar advise me that this cheaperpolicy that they offered was not really a great idea in the long rrun for me. Frustrated, I set up a loan policy but needed toset up my other homes with this company as well, so it wasquite a process! \r\n\r\nWhen I contacted Nationstar regarding the new policy I wasadvised that I had to start the process again but reassuredthat I would get the same terms. Again I was asked to redothe rate lock over and over and each time with bad numbers. \r\nThe loan was supposed to cover the payoffs of the XXXX loans ( roughly {$86000.00} ) plus closing costs, with credit for escrowfunds paid ; leaving a loan total of {$88000.00}. Nationstar keptcoming up with a {$90000.00} loan plus money to bring to closing. \r\n\r\nBy the end of XXXX I began to demand a closing date. Ithen received an email from an underwrited, XXXX that sheneeded Shedule E of my tax returns ( which she had ). Myloan processor apologized for her, then began to whineabout my XXXX hour workweek and how it meant that I needed tto bring more money to the table or wrap it into the loan tocover other minor bills ; most of which I had paid or about topay off. In addition I had submitted my XXXX balance ( decent ) to help with my debt to income ratio to helpqualify for the loan package that I wanted. \r\n\r\nThen to top it off he threatened to want to dealve into myfianc 's finances which would have not been an issue in thebeginning of this process but ridiculous at this point. Whynow??? \r\n\r\nI am totally frustrated by the incompetence and lack ofprofessionalism on behalf of Nationstar. I feel that onlyone agent ( XXXX ) knew what he was doing and that hebecame embarrassed by the botched process inearly XXXX and has been in the background since. \r\nI feel that Nationstar has been a disservice to me and Iam trying to get away from this company as fast as I can!",

He stated we had nothing to lose just the possibility of having lower payments on our mortgage and they were doing a lot of these refinances. I spoke with my husband and we agreed this would be a good fit based on what we were told. We started the process of the refinance. I was told we qualified and we were going to be able to save almost {$400.00} a month. Our payment was going to go from {$1700.00} to {$1300.00} however when we received our XXXX bill the payment due was {$1400.00} but the interest rate stayed the same at 3.75 %. The escrow account we currently had would transfer to the new loan number. We closed in XXXX of XXXX however, we were told we had to pay {$1600.00} at closing. I explained we were told there were to be no closing costs and I was told by the Title Agent XXXX XXXX that the money was the next payment due for the new loan which was not true. Then in XXXX XXXX when the tax bill came out it stated we owed {$2200.00}. Stonegate Mortgage Corp never transferred the original escrow account but instead paid it to the principal of the new loan. After looking at the new loan papers again they increased the principle loan balance of the original loan and then paid it back down with our escrow account without our permission. I then brought my HUD statement to a loan officer to review what happen. I was then told we were indeed charge closing cost, thousands of dollars in closing cost in fact, we where charged new loan origination fees and multiple other fees that were not necessary. More importantly our property taxes were not calculated correctly on purpose. It shows on the HUD we were paying {$250.00} a month for escrow in our original loan, but they only allotted for {$41.00} for escrow so therefore our property taxes had not been paid for all of XXXX By Stonegate Mortgage Corp and the Title Company, XXXX XXXX XXXX making our taxes {$41.00} that was how they were able to give us the \" savings '' on our monthly mortgage payment on our refinance.

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an email that my credit had been issued in the amount of {$910.00}, but yet it did not appear online or on my monthly statement. I called to ask about why my credit had not yet appeared online or on my statement and was told this could take up to 3 months to appear. When I received my statement with the closing date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I was in complete surprise to see that the credit I had made numerous phone calls about in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX had not yet been applied to my account. However, a charge in the amount of {$910.00} was now showing on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for a purchase at the XXXX XXXX store, which is 2 hours from my home, and therefore my credit card statement had almost doubled. I did not authorize a charge in this amount on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I assumed this was a mistake and that some how the credit I was supposed to have received had been charged by accident. I then started making several calls to Macy and explained these circumstances over and over and no one was able to help me. Finally, after having spoken to XXXX+ people from Macy 's furniture, Macy 's credit, and Macy 's customer service, and getting bounced back and forth with no one able to do anything to fix my account, I submitted a claim online to dispute a charge and submitted the paperwork on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I then received a credit to my account for {$910.00}. However, this did not fix the problem that I was in fact billed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX the {$910.00}. The fact remains that someone charged my account {$910.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX without my authorization for merchandise that I do not have. I have been calling Macy 's and spoken to their fraud, credit, furniture, and customer service departments and have gotten no where. I get passed back and forth between these departments and no one can resolve this issue and they all point fingers at each other. At this point in time, my balance has been accumulating interest and late fees, which I refuse to pay. Macy 's is destroying my credit score and I do n't know how to escalate this higher within their organization. I have copies of the paperwork and emails that I can provide as backup to you if needed. Please help me in resolving this issue. It will be a year next month since the original purchase and I am so upset about what they are doing to my credit because no one that I speak to ( including managers ) have any authority to do anything. Today I received a letter in the mail that says that Macy 's believed they have resolved my issue by issuing the credit in XXXX XXXX, but they still have not acknowledged that I was in fact double charged. Please let me know what recourse I have against them. Do I need to get a lawyer at this point? Thank you.",

        "On XX/XX/2016, I requested a cancellation of a Timeshare purchase made on XX/XX/2016 for {$22000.00}, well within the merchant 's cancellation period. The amount was split between my credit card and my husband 's credit card for {$10000.00} and {$12000.00} each. We requested the cancellation because of the merchant 's intent to defraud, which we found out after the transaction. We were basically pressured and hurried through signing the documents but after taking time to review them on our own, we found out a lot of things did n't add up. After requesting cancellation, the merchant kept pressuring us to keep the Timeshare, promising to include additional benefits. They would not cancel and send us a confirmation. So, we decided to make our credit card companies aware of the issue and filed for a dispute. \r\n\r\nAfter submitting all the required documentation to XXXX XXXX at Elan Financial Services claims department on XXXX/XXXX/2016, the credit card servicing company for Fidelity, I made several calls in an attempt to reach her and get status update on the dispute but those attempts were futile. The last two times, I got to speak to XXXX other people who claimed Elan Financial Services was awaiting additional information from XXXX XXXX before they could proceed with my claim. They also went further to say that the outcome of my case would depend on the information received from XXXX XXXX because my files were transferred over to Elan Financial Services when Fidelity changed management of its credit card services to Elan Financial Services. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the Timeshare company sent me a deed for a completely different package than was in the original contract 2 weeks ago, degrading it from Lifetime to Tenured. I was waiting to hear back from the claims reviewer so I could provide this new information. But yesterday morning, I looked at my statement and saw the {$10000.00} had been charged back to my card. On the other hand, the {$12000.00} charged to my husband 's card had since been reversed in XX/XX/XXXX because XXXX resolved the dispute permanently in my husband 's favor after doing their due diligence and investigation. Elan Financial Service mishandled my dispute and paid little attention to my case from day one. There was no incentive to give my claims due attention because according to the supervisor, the transaction did n't occur under them. \r\n\r\nMy husband has a XXXX XXXX card, just like I have a Fidelity Visa card. So, how is it that XXXX and Fidelity reached XXXX different conclusions on the matter? Is the merchant now willing to accept only {$10000.00} from me and let the other {$12000.00} go? And is the {$10000.00} supposed to now be for the downgraded package without my knowledge and consent? I can provide evidence that the case was resolved in my husband 's favor and also evidence of my request to cancel the transaction, in addition to a copy of the deed for the downgraded package that was mailed to my house. This is something I never purchased! Had the claims processor done due diligence, that should have been grounds for a permanent charge back to the merchant. \r\n\r\nI called 6 times since yesterday, spoke with different people at the Fidelity office, and Elan Financial Services fraud and claims department. I spoke with a supervisor who told me they reached the decision based on the information provided by XXXX XXXX since the transaction occurred under them. He said there was nothing he could do to help me and that I could contact their President for an appeal. XXXX XXXX ca n't help either since they no longer service my credit card.This decision amounts to siding with the merchants intent to defraud me and making me pay for something I never purchased. This is really unsettling. I have had the Fidelity credit card for years and never carried a balance on my credit account. I always pay my balances off every month no matter how small or large.",

The minimum payment was around {$120.00} and I always sent {$130.00} to $ XXXX monthly. We have not used this card except for XXXX which was about {$10.00} a month. So my payment should have went down with the payment I was making. Well when I talked to them after receiving the collection agency notice they told me it is not there responsibility to send out a statement. I said the email they were sending it to was no longer a valid email and he said it does n't matter. I also asked why no one called. You would think if you have a good customer who makes payments on time every month that you would at least make a phone call. Again they said it is not there responsibility. Again I take some responsibility but I never used the card since like XXXX and I know with the payments I was making that I still had a year or so till it would have been paid off. They were not helpful at all. I have flawless credit and now my credit report is showing that I have not made any payment since XXXX of XXXX. As you can see I made the payment every month. I also asked for all the statements for XXXX. When I received them they have been charging me for Payment Safeguard which again I never signed up for. How can they charge people for services that they never signed up for. So now that my minimum due is more than I was sending every month they charged me a late fee from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. When I called the collection agency they told me that my payment due is now almost {$900.00}. They also told me that Citi Bank reduced our credit line so now they are charging me for an over the credit line fee. I again never received a notice that they are lowering this. The only mailing I received in XXXX was the notice from the collection agency. I have attached the statements from Citi Bank.",

I authorized the closing of XXXX of the XXXX accounts but did NOT authorize the closing of the operating account as I had to get to XXXX ASAP to say good bye to my Father who is in XXXX. I already had planr, car and hotel reservations made and would need the debit card when I arrived in XXXX.

The fraud people were explained that I would have to go in person to the bank to get a new card and since the local branches did n't open until XXXX and I had to be at the airport by XXXX I was given the address and phone number of the branch closest to the XXXX airport. It was agreed that BB & T would keep the account open until I picked up the rental car in XXXX and gor to the Branch to pick up a temporary card. I thought all was well until this morning when I tried to get gas and discovered the account was locked. I have spent the entire day trying to get BB & T to unlock the account. This morning at XXXX I waas told by customer service that he would have to investigate before opening the account but that he would call me no later than XXXX. When he did n't call I tried to call again to discover that he had left for the day. around XXXX I reached someone named XXXX who said he was a supervisor in customer service and that it was his decision not to release the account and that he had notified the fraud department of his decision. He then disconnected the call. In a XXXX, I called the Fraud people back and explained that after multiple calls, always getting different people, being on hold until the call disconnected I was getting desperate. IN the meantime I found out that my Father was worse. I considered delaying the trip one day but without the card I ca n't change the reservations and now realized that if I did n't get there tomorrow afternoon I might not see him alive. The fraud people said their hands were tied. XXXX stayed over an hour after she was due to go home trying to get someone to release the account without succeeding. \r\nWe are XXXX and this is a Business account. We do n't use credit and have no other cards. We have only the money in our pockets. I have no way to get to the branch in XXXX without a car.

        "I received a phone call from a company  call C & M associates  who told me I owed over {$4000.00} on a credit card account issued to me by  XXXX  Bank in  XXXX . They offered to settle the debt out for {$1700.00}. After going over my records I could find no information that I ever had this credit card, nor any indications from my bank records that I ever paid anything on this account nor does my credit reports show any indication that this account was in arrears. To the best of my recollection I never had this account, never received statements from that bank, nor did I ever receive any calls or dunning letters from collection agencies, other banks who bought out this debt from   XXXX   XXXX   until yesterda  XXXX    XXXX   . After 14 years I talked to only the man who called me yesterday and offered me a settlement on this account. He never identified himself as a debt collector and when I asked him if he worked as a debt collector he said no that he worked for a debt acquisition company. I asked this man to send all documents pertaining to this account and he agreed. Although he never orally told me the name of the company he worked for it showed on my caller ID to be  C & M associates. I looked up the company online and contacted them. At first they told me they had no information at all under the case number provided to me. Then I was transferred to another man who told me the case had been closed. However he could not open the file himself and I was directed to a supervisor who had access to the file who opened it and said it was closed to do \" refusal to pay ''. I never refused to pay but asked for documentation of this debt. I was then told I could settle this debt for \" let 's say {$500.00} '' and I said no that until they could show me some documents which showed I actually owed this debt I would not pay anything to resolve the matter at hand.. He promised to look into further and contact me if he found evidence of ID THEFT. As  I said above over a 14 year period I have never received any communication from  XXXX  Bank, Collections Agencies or any of the banks that  XXXX  Bank sold out there credit card debt too. As I understand it this debt was sold to   XXXX   XXXX  , then to  XXXX  and finally to  XXXX  &  XXXX . After that it was sold to a number of debt acquisition companies before ending  up with C & M Associates. As I h ave said, first the man I spoke to did not inform me he was trying to collect a debt, and I over a 14 year period have never received any communications in any form as to the status of this credit card account, so I was never given a chance to dispute it, plus there are no record of this debt on my credit reports or my bank records. I am left with many questions about  XXXX  Bank a nd C & M Associates.  It is hard for me to believe that this debt was floating around for 14 years and I never received any communication from a  Debt  Collector, nor that it does not show in anyway on my credit reports. I am dumbfounded by this and any advice your agency would provide me would greatly be appreciated.",

I paid on this account to avoid any disparaging credit notifications to the credit bureaus. I told him twice to send the information and to date have not received anything! This is the first time I have seen anything as it was posted to the Consumer Protection 's website where I filed the claim. \r\n2. In 2009 I did not report the account stolen - I reported that my credit protection account said that an account was opened and had been Aware. I said no and they gave me the number to call and I promptly called to report the issue - they said no problem in closing the account and investigating. \r\nI ca n't even remember the name of the bank I called affiliated with this account at this time. I never reopened an account at that time!! They must have done that in their own. \r\n3. I have been paying on XXXX PayPal accounts thinking all along this corrupt account started without my permission was just XXXX account. Now I have XXXX PayPal accounts that at one time was XXXX XXXX XXXX - which I had paid off and closed. \r\n4. The payments that I did send - even when a statement was not sent - were not applied at the time sent and this is reflected in the inaccurate paper work supplied by this synchrony bank. I would receive statements saying I had not paid for two months. I also paid outrageous and continue to pay late fees whe 5. I paid online numerous times and do not even see any payments applied to this account- I tried many times to explain that payments sent to protect my credit - until this nightmare would be over, could not even be found!!! \r\n6. I never ever said to open another account when I called to report this account should not be opened. I have no idea what the balances represents as I feel I paid twice for anything bought online due to the fact I was using my own bank debit card! \r\n7. No legitimate information over the years of requests were granted to me and none of the information posted to this account is legitimate to me. to verify this account over years. The countless times when i called about my account two months behind, because They would then leave messages for me back then should be further proof that they made contact and I continued to tell callers that I have no idea as to why this account exists and requested more than 10 times verification of the account and a full accounting and statements. Never were they sent until I got In Touch with the consumer financial protection agency at the US government - had I received any type of follow up. \r\n6. I demand that this unscrupulous entity be charged with unauthorized use of my personal information. I have an excellent payment record and I allow the Bureau to check that out - they will see that this company PayPal is the only one reporting negatively about me. I pay my bills when received and this is what I did with this company - not knowing it is crazy. \r\n7. I have been harmed by this entity and continue to be so with lack of accountability for this mystery account. This nightmare feels like it will never end. I was advised by my credit reporting company to file against PayPal too! \r\nIt just goes on. I will file many complaints as needed- for however long it takes to get my credit and get the money back that was stolen and mishandled countless times. \r\n8.I have had excellent credit with no delinquencies for over 30 years till PayPal",

The Chase representative I spoke to told me that Chase can close any account at any time with no explanation or legitimate reason. When we escalate our complaint to Chase 's executive office, they tell us that Chase does n't want me as customer and in order to keep the account open the company I work for must remove me from the account. Chase openly engages is discriminatory business practices. I did nothing wrong to deserve this kind of treatment. One week after Chase mailed me checks for the business and a debit card, someone else at Chase decided to close down the account if I am not removed as a signer. Maybe they do n't like my XXXX name. They wo n't provide any of us with a reason why they are closing the account. All we were told was that no reason or explanation has to be given and that they can close any account anytime they want. Total abuse of power.",
